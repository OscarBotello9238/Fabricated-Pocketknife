# Fabricated-Pocketknife
In this repository I showcases the completed design and manufacturing process of a custom pocketknife. Techniques used include manual lathe operation, waterjet cutting, 3D printing, investment casting, and other conventional fabrication methods. This project emphasizes the integration of multiple manufacturing processes to produce a functional and well-engineered final product.I include documentation of video, CAD models and photos.
Jumping into this project as a freshman mechanical engineering student was eye definitely eye opening. I’ve always been curious and hands-on, but this experience completely shifted how I see the world of manufacturing it’s not just about designing and machining. it’s about solving real-world problems with efficiency and creativity. One of the most common challenges I encountered was realizing that what works in CAD doesn’t always translate easily to fabrication and the real world. The question quickly became not just “how do I design this?” but “how do I manufacture this efficiently and affordably?
