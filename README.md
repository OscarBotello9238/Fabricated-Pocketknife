# Fabricated-Pocketknife
This repository showcases the complete design and manufacturing process of a custom pocketknife. Techniques used include manual lathe operation, waterjet cutting, 3D printing, investment casting, and other conventional fabrication methods. The project emphasizes the integration of multiple manufacturing processes to produce a functional and well-engineered final product. Documentation includes CAD models, photos,
Jumping into this project as a freshman mechanical engineering student was eye-opening. I‚Äôve always been curious and hands-on, but this experience completely shifted how I see the world of manufacturing it‚Äôs not just about designing and machining; it‚Äôs about solving real-world problems with efficiency and creativity. One of the most common challenges I encountered was realizing that what works in CAD doesn‚Äôt always translate easily to fabrication. The question quickly became not just ‚Äúhow do I design this?‚Äù but ‚Äúhow do I manufacture this efficiently and affordably?
